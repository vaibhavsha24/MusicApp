   - **ViewModel (Jetpack)** is used to store UI state and handle business logic.  
   - **LiveData & StateFlow** are used for managing state updates reactively.  
   
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Layer (Repository & API Handling)**  
   - **Repository Pattern** is used to handle data from multiple sources (API & Local Storage).  
   - **Retrofit** is used for handling API calls with proper error handling.  
   - **Hilt Dependency Injection** ensures modular, testable, and reusable components.  
   
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Service Layer (Foreground Service & PiP Mode)**  
   - **Foreground Service** keeps the music player running in the background.  
   - **ExoPlayer** is used to play, pause, and manage song playback efficiently.
